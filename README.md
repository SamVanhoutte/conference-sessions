### 7 things I learned from coaching and investing in cloud startups

__Abstract:__
Not many companies are more exciting to work for than cloud startups. Employees at a startup are really making an impact with every decision that is taken. The difference with working in the enterprise world is huge.
In this session, Sam will share several things and insights he gained from working with several software (cloud) startups. Seven things that he believes can be applied to many projects and products. He will discuss architectural principles, technology choices, and quality decisions and their impact on the success of the startup. But the session will also cover some business aspects, such as pricing models and feature priorities.

### Time traveling in the cloud. Time series analytics with Microsoft Azure.

__Abstract:__
The data collected in IoT scenarios are often thought of as a ‘time series”. Through this data it’s possible to understand the past and use this data to anticipate the future. But time traveling is never straight forward. That’s why in this session Sam will walk you through the processing of time series data and he'll discuss some common roadblocks in time series analytics.

Not only will we focus on time series analytics and predictions for the future but you’ll also see which Azure services can be used and how they can be applied. We will tackle Time Series Insights, Azure Machine Learning and Azure Data Explorer and how they can be combined in data driven solutions.
